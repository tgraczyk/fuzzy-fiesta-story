There once was a boy named Muffin. Muffin was in elementary school.
Muffin got picked on a lot because of his name. Nobody knows why his
parents named him this way. 
Every time, after Muffin was laughed by his classmates for his strange name,
he asked his father:"Dad why you and mom called me 'Muffin', my classmates
are always laguhed at me. It should be a name for a desssert not a boy!"
However, Muffin's father and mother never explained why, they just smile at 
him and changed a topic.
